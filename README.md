# JPACRUDProject


## DESCRIPTION
This project implements basic CRUD operations using Java Persistence API (JPA) and Spring MVC on a MySQL database, in a Full-Stack Application. 
The Full-Stack Application is my version of a Record Shop. Displaying the user with Multiple pages and a stylish setup to sort, search and create Records for the shops inventory.
The application allows the user of the webpage to interacts with a single table, mapped to a JPA entity, and offers a web interface to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

# Project Needs to be overlooked and finished with full operations for the front-end.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
 	* AWS: Deployment
 	* Java: Spring MVC, JPA
 	* JUnit: Testing for JPA Mappings
 	* MySQL: Database
 	* CSS, HTML
 
## CONCEPTS
The concepts of this project are creating a webapage for a user to use 

 # CRUD Operations:

  * Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database.

  * Currently, in my CRUD operations. Create, Read, Update, and Delete are mapped correctly, with given debug print lines to verify that the projects EntityManager is working.

  * Stacktrace populated with messages verifying Persist, Flush, and Commits are taking place.

  * Method to search by ID is also implemented

# Spring MVC Web Interface:

 * All database access is encapsulated in the 'DatabaseAccessorObject' class.

  * User interaction via webpage.

# LESSONS
As i do feel this is a step up in my path of knowledge. doing this soley on my own instead of a group project left me with a few challenges of becoming lost in the magnitude of the very project itself. I feel as I wasnt expecting so many little issues to be overlooked on a project this size. Typos, code formatting. So on. 

Many things were challenging for me. A few being working front and and back end. I do feel I bit off more than I could chew with my excitement of my data selection. But thats a lesson learned for future projects. I became lost in my own code trying to find out where my error could be hidden. Leaving me to scramble, disorganized. Which prevented me from fully completeing the projects requirements. 

Although, through rigerous stack trace reading. The project is in full effect. deployed using EC2!
